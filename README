== Notes

Most of the views utilize the jqGrid plugin, with data fetched via controllers that output JSON.  

A 'resourceful' class (in the lib folder) is used to provide standard CRUD methods to all controller models in a REST fashion, including being able to output special JSON that is needed for the jqGrid plugin.  Some controllers utilize additional methods for special needs.  Be sure to check the config/routes.rb file for those special cases and if you need to add more.

== Requirements

* Rails 3.0.5 or better
* MySQL 4

= Gems

See Gemfile for full list.  Run 'bundle install' to get them.

= Authentication

The 'Devise' and 'CanCan' gems are used for authentication and roles based permissions. 

See http://github.com/plataformatec/devise and http://github.com/ryanb/cancan

Currently the app uses the default views for user signup and login.  You can generate the views into files for full customization by running:

rails generate devise:views

= Javascript frameworks

The site uses the Jquery and is configured so that the Rails javascript helpers utilize jQuery instead of Prototype.

* jQuery 1.5 or better
* jQuery UI 1.8 or better (Cupertino theme in use)
  * All UI Core
  * All interactions
  * All widgets except slider
  * Effects: core, blind, fade, highlight
